### Core Concept

<table style="border: none;">
    <tr style="border: none;">
        <td style="border: none;">
            Tasked with protecting a sacred light from the encroaching darkness, they must navigate the night and evade the minions of the dark. Chased by the "darkness" and its zealous supporters, the acolyte's mission is to ensure the flame remains lit, representing hope for another day. With just 5 minutes until dawn, every second counts, for if the flame is extinguished, fear will spread unchecked throughout the land.

### Player Movement

- 8-directional movement system (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- Walking backwards incurs speed penalty

### Enemies and Combat

- Enemies are ghost-like creatures with a melee attack or ranged attack

- Around 6 enemy attacks will reduce the player to 0 health

### Enemy Spawning and Behaviour

- Enemies attempt to spawn in a random position in a radius of 5 around the player.
- Enemies will attempt to find valid spawn positions up to 10 times before a spawn fails.
- If the spawn was successful the spawner will wait 7.5 seconds before attempting to spawn another, otherwise it will wait a quarter of that time.
- Each successful attempt has a 25% chance of spawning a ranged enemy and a 75% chance of spawning a melee enemy.
- Enemies will despawn if their distance from the player passes 7.
- Spawning will continue for as long as the number of living enemies is less than 5 + the number of minutes since game start.
- Enemies will wander around until they have line of sight of the player, and will move to the players last known position when line of sight is lost
- Ranged enemies will wait and fire from their vision range while the player is still visible
- All enemies have a 50% chance of dropping either a health potion or fuel, with equal probability

Inspiration for games where light is important for gameplay include Cryospace and Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

### Central Fire

<p align="center">
    <img src="Images/central_fire.png" width="300">
</p>

- Fire need to stay lit, for that to happen the player needs to light torches and candles that are spread across the map
- If the fire goes out, the player dies
- Since there is no light source lit at the beginning, we have built in a delay of 30 seconds.
- Depending on how many light sources are lit, the size of the fire changes (calculation of the states in the table below)
- The light sources can also be blown out again by enemies or by a random snuff effect that we have implemented (Therefore, the player must constantly light the light sources and cannot light them only once at the beginning and then hide)

| State            | 0   | 1     | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5       |
| ---------------- | --- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Lightsources lit | 0%  | 1-20% | 21-40% | 41-60% | 61-80% | 81-100% |

### Camera/View

- Fixed rotation 3rd person isometric with approx. 45¬∞ viewing angle
- Player is locked to centre of screen (camera moves with player movement)
- When the player reaches the edge of the game world, they will be slightly off centre; this allows the player to see more of the game world while near its edge.
  - This is demonstrated in the diagram below. Note how in FOV 2 the player is off-centre.

<p align="center">
    <img src="Images/camera_movement.png" width="400">
</p>
   
- We have decided to use a moving camera as it can make the gameplay feel more dynamic - well suited to the action/horror genre

Underrail (2015) is a good example of the intended viewing angle:

<p align="center">
<img src="Images/underrail_screenshot.jpg" width="300">
</p>
And Synthetik (2018) uses a camera locked to the players movements:

    <img src="Images/Keyboard_edit_crop.png" width="500">
    <img src="Images/Mouse_edit_1.png" width="287">
</p>

- Left Shift to _dash_, briefly increasing movement speed.
- Escape button to show pause menu while in game (Implemented so that the player can check the controls again during the game)

### Progression

As a roguelite-inspired game, Lantern Head features permadeath and items that do not persist between playthroughs.

Within a single playthrough, difficulty will increase due to
attrition of resources if the player overuses their potions/lantern oil

## World Design

Lantern Head takes place within the confines of an abandoned religious compound, in the style of an old-world monastery or cathedral.

This temple shows signs of advanced decay, as plant growth gradually reclaims the crumbling masonry, giving the player the sense that they are the last defender of this place against the unknown and wild forces outside its walls.

One inspiration for this is the abandoned 12th-century Monastery of Santa Maria de Sei√ßa in Portugal:

<p align="center">
    <img src="Images/Mosteiro-de-Santa-Maria-de-Sei√ßa-1-van-1.jpg" width="300">
    <img src="Images/Mosteiro-de-Santa-Maria-de-Sei√ßa-1-van-1-6.jpg" width="140">

And this abandoned church photographed by Roman Robroek:

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Layout

The game will take place entirely indoors. The level design will take inspiration from real-life religious buildings.

<p align="center">
        <img src="Images/Game_Layout.png" width="500">
        <p align="center"> The world will feature sections ranging from grand halls to claustrophobic corridors.
</p>



### Game World Graphics and Physics

The game world will be rendered in "2.5D" using a pixel art tileset. The tilemap will be overlayed with a static collider for simple player-object and enemy-object collisions.

No elements in the game world will require other physics simulation.

Light and shadow is an important gameplay element in Lantern Head. Lighting will be handled by Unity's 2D Universal Render Pipeline (URP), which enables 2D objects (such as sprites) to interact with light and cast shadows as if they were 3D objects.

Towards the very end of the game, the sun will begin to rise. It is intended that a gradient of light intensity and color will provide a visual to hint the player that they are close to finish the game. A global lighting gradient mockup, with respect to game time, can be seen below.

### Interactivity

## Art and Audio

<b> Art Style: Pixel Art </b>

Our team loves the pixel art style and thinks that it will be the best fit for our game for the following reasons:

- <b>Unique Aesthetic Appeal</b>: Utilizing pixel art for a horror game adds a distinctive visual charm that stands out in a genre dominated by realistic graphics.
- <b>Engage player's imagination</b>: Pixel art invites players to engage their imaginations, filling in the gaps between pixels with their perceptions of fear. This active participation can intensify the player's overall horror experience.
- <b>Showcase the potential of pixel art style</b>: Pushing the boundaries of pixel art by demonstrating that pixel art can effectively evoke fear, suspense, and mystery.

<b>Color and Atmosphere</b>: The game is going to implement a high contrast between light and shadow with mainly dark blue or green color to build an overall suspenseful and dark atmosphere
