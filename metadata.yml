GameTitle: Lantern Head
GameBlurb: >
  Dive into the dark, foreboding world of "Lantern Head", a uniquely crafted isometric, rogue-lite(-like) horror action game. Set in the decaying confines of an ancient religious compound reminiscent of old-world monasteries, players take on the role of the last keeper of a sacred flame, a devoted figure transformed into a living lantern. The core mission: Protect this dwindling beacon of hope from the encroaching darkness and its malevolent minions. Every minute counts in the 5-minute countdown to dawn, as the flame's extinction could unleash a terror that engulfs the land. In this pixel art adventure, light and shadow are more than mere visuals; they are the essence of gameplay. The lantern's light serves dual purposes, guiding players and revealing stealthy foes. This high-contrast environment is both your weapon and your weakness. "Lantern Head" promises an immersive experience that blurs the lines between light and darkness, hope and despair.
